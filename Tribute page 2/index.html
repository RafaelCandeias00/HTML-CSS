        <p>Valentino Rossi (born 16 February 1979) is an Italian professional motorcycle road racer and multiple MotoGP World Champion.</p>
        <p>Rossi is widely considered one of the greatest motorcycle racers of all time, with nine Grand Prix World Championships to his name – seven of which are in the premier class. Rossi is also the only road racer to have competed in 400 or more Grands Prix. He has ridden with number 46 his entire career, including the years when he was defending his title.</p>
        <p>Rossi is currently contracted to race until the end of the 2020 season, when he will be 41 years old. Although it has been confirmed Rossi will leave the Factory Yamaha team at the end of 2020, Yamaha has already offered Rossi a factory bike and support with the manufacturer in another team. Rossi is currently in talks with the Petronas Yamaha Racing Team for the 2021 season.</p>
        <p>Rossi is superstitious and renowned for his pre-ride rituals. On a race day, he will always watch the beginning of the Moto3 race to see how long the starting lights remain lit before going out at the start of the race. Prior to riding (whether racing, qualifying, or practice), he will start his personal ritual by stopping about two metres from his bike, bending over and reaching for his boots. Then, when arriving at his bike, he will crouch down and hold the right-side foot-peg, with his head bowed. In an interview, Rossi said "It’s just a moment to focus and ‘talk’ to my bike, like moving from one place to the next. He adjusts the fit of his leathers by standing straight up on the foot-pegs, whilst riding down the pit-lane before the start of race or practice. He also revealed in an interview with <a href="#">MotoGP.com</a> that he always puts one particular boot on before the other, as well as one particular glove on before the other, and that he always gets on the bike the same way. He also gets off the bike in the same way, swinging his right leg over the front of the bike.</p>
